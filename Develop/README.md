# I generated the rows quickly, but it was hard to add functionality to it. My tutor helped me make my dynamic HTML code dryer and also made the classes a lot more simple. 
# I initially used meridiem time. I changed some logic to use military time and was able to get rid of an entire function (colorOfBrackground()) that way. 
# I only added 1 CSS function. Line 73 of the CSS file. 
# I learned how to use moment.js more effectively.
# All requirements have been met.
